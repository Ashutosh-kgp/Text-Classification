Hi Siva,
Thanks for that.
Cross checking some of the timestamps from the empty cells within the exported excel sheet against the collecting logs i can see alot of warnings such as:

Line 2852: WARNING    -- [2018-10-13 05:00:39 BST] -- SmPollingData::skipMissedPollings(): emc-smarts : APM1-S-RBS-roc (conf/smarts-pm.xml): 194.863 s late, 2 polling loop(s) missed and next polling will start 194.863 s late...

This indicates that polling cycle's from the Smarts Collector were missed and unable to complete due to a delay in the previous polling cycle(s).
When this happens, typically speaking, it is usually as a result of the SAM domain (in this case APMS1) being busy or unable to process the collectors request within the set period of the polling cycle.
This may happen for example in large SAM domains (is APM1 a large domain?) or possibility when there is a re-discovery happening at the time within the domain.

Hi Siva,
The log snippet in my previous mail referred to the Smarts Collector:

Line 2852: WARNING	 -- [2018-10-13 05:00:39 BST] -- SmPollingData::skipMissedPollings(): emc-smarts : APM1-S-RBS-roc (conf/smarts-pm.xml): 194.863 s late, 2 polling loop(s) missed and next polling will start 194.863 s late...

From this sample output we can see a late polling cycle.
There are many other similar warning's throughout the Smarts Collecting logs.
All of which indicate that at times during the W4N polling and collecting cycles (from the W4N Smarts Collector) there are delay's collecting metrics from the specific Smarts Domains.
As i was saying this can happen for a number of reasons, such as,

When the Smarts Collector is polling a large SAM domain.
Or if the Smarts domain being polled, is busier than normal at the time of polling, such as when a rediscovery is happening. This would lead to a knock on effect in the W4N Smarts Collector itself.

Thanks
Kieran

We are getting a mismatch in the IONIX KIC report and actual IONIX NCM tool. Devices are present and getting discovered in NCM but not being recorded as 'successfully discovered' in the KIC report. On reaching out to the KIC POC, she pointed out to us that they prepared the report from the IONIX dump they receive. As per her explanation, the fields 'ATTAMPT_TIME' and 'SUCCESS_TIME' needs to be populated in order to treat this as a 'successfully discovered' records as per KIC norms. Currently all the records are being treated as 'Device previously discovered but not currently reachable'. Please get this resolved ASAP.

The following devices are not being discovered properly in Ionix, which means that they are at risk as they have no backups currently:

This deivce should be a Cisco Nexus 5596 Switch but instead Ionix is detecting it as an OmniSwitch.

We have other devices in Ionix that are already discovered correctly and this is the first time we are seeing this - quite randomly.

Other device affected is nbs-h-acsw-stc-012 - 172.31.169.31

Team,

I have already reached out to Dinesh regarding this so would appreciate it if this task can be assigned to him. 

We have a number of new devices being brought online within the NBS network. A sample is as follows:

Cisco Nexus 9318 switch (2 more models to come)
Cisco Catalyst 9300 series switch (1 or 2 more models to come)
Cisco ISR 4321 Router

We request that Dinesh is assigned to assist us as and when the devices are accessible and also to support us with already existing communications with EMC with regards to Drivers and Certification. 

This request will most likely stay open for a while whilstt the discovery for the above models proceed.

Hello Team,
There are some devices which are not communicating with TACACs server and thus they are not accessible by Tacacs credentials. Because of this login Failure , Ionix is not able to take the config (startup and running) backup of these devices.
But we checked that these devices could be communicated by SNMP and Ionix is using SNMP to pull some of the System Properties(like sysname, Model, OS version etc).
But when we tried taking the config Backup using SNMP/TFTP it failed with the following erro

I think most of these  questions need to be answered by Thurso after the initial SMARTs build is done. 
Those I can confirm are highlighted below.

Customer: NHS ORKNEY  Network: ORKNEY_NHS_SIP  
Please configure ORKNEY_NHS_SIP   prefix nhso- onto the DLSS.
This customer solution is expected to have 2 devices under management.
The network will be connected to CS-Rainbow and will use IP Management Range: 172.108.204.240/28
These devices and their notifications need to be visible in the following GSAM views, and buckets.

Hi Romil, Vishwajit

Based on data analysis from last three weekly reports it shows the below pasted devices are not getting monitored for any event /incidents (Not even once).

Please let us know the snmp version on device so that NIAB team can check configuration at their end.

If that doesn?t solve issue , I will raise a problem task to engage all relevant stakeholders.

Hi Danish,

As discussed, we can see there is down alams and as well Unstable alarms for the same site.

Down alarms got cleared before the wait time in ticketing system. Hence ticket not generated. However for unstable shows interface was continuously down/up.

You can check the historic alarms for particuler period of time. Please select 1 day and then change the display for the time duration on Historic Events.

Regards,
Suryadip

Hi Suryadip,

I ahve checked the below device interfaces and found these are still down for so long and there is no open ticket. Can you please check why no ticket is there for the down interfaces.

In W4N the Device Health reports for Gateways  ( All>>...Commerzbank VoIP CUCM>>Devices Health - All Devices>>)  in the pre-live and In-live environment the thershold is currently set to 75%. As all analogue gateways (AGW)  by default use about 77% of the Memory on I/O, the device health report shows ongoingly a violation of this threshold.
Therefore the threshold for Memory Utilization of gateways should be set to 80%.

Hi Mohamed, 

I can see Temperature alarms in ?All CSAM? viewlet. However, the request was to amend filters to allow Temperature alarm production viewlet i.e., Tier1 UNACK, Tier2/3 UNACK, Tier 4/5 UNACK , ALL ACK, ALL TICKETED. 

Can you please check and resolve. This is urgent to do this on Cardiff.

We have noticed that we are getting bandwidth only for output direction from the device  . Thus only output direction is reporting on Watch4net for the mentioned device.

We are not receiving required Qos Bandwidth for input direction from the device end. Thus please make sure it is corrected at the device end.

Hi Team,

We are checking on the part for the data SMARTS got during the polling. 

We can see the graph and it close to zero. However i will check while downloading the report in excel why it showing zero.


How we are still working on this to get the RCA for the same.


Regards,
Suryadip

Hi Divya,

It means these are PING only ?

We will check on this if the polling class has been changed for these devices to ICMONLY or not and will action accordingly.

Hi DBA Team,

We are unable to create constraint on niab_devices table. Could you please create it, please find below DB details and error details which we are getting while creating a constraint.

Table_name :   niab_devices
username : lbg_dl
hostname: bcp11262001-scan-oravip.dci.bt.com
Port: 61901
Serivce name : ixdlp_any



ALTER TABLE NIAB_DEVICES  ADD CONSTRAINT UNQ_BFG_ID UNIQUE (BFG_ID)
Error report:
SQL Error: ORA-01591: lock held by in-doubt distributed transaction 23.11.5724
01591. 00000 -  ""lock held by in-doubt distributed transaction %s""
*Cause:    Trying to access resource that is locked by a dead two-phase commit
           transaction that is in prepared state.
*Action:   DBA should query the pending_trans$ and related tables, and attempt
           to repair network connection(s) to coordinator and commit point.
           If timely repair is not possible, DBA should contact DBA at commit
           point if known or end user for correct outcome, or use heuristic
           default if given to issue a heuristic commit or abort command to
           finalize the local portion of the distributed transaction.

We would not be able to create the constraint if the lock is still held. In the first instance your ASG DBA should review the transaction holding the lock:

Hello.
I am Service Manager for JCB and every month making Monthly band utilization report for JCB.
For the December and ""IN-Direction"", Max and Ave is very small. But data for OUT direction seems as usual.
This can see most (or all) circuit for JCB.
Please answer asap.

Related question with CD778517.
-------------
I have seen the below case which seems very strange.
In Monthly export CSV Max is 30%, while Weekly export in that month shows Max is 70%.
If that is the case, Monthly Max shuold have 70%.
Is this something related to how Ontario samples the data. Eg. Monthly Utilization data only pick up from 24 hours internal data. Weekly util data picks up every 4 hours. Daily util data picks up every 5min. 
Let me know asap. 
I need to understand the logic of Ontario.

HI Nikhil,

I?m happy to close those as we are now getting files. Regarding the other devices:

NODRM1CRH1 - Skybox has not received an updated config in 26 days so we need an up to date config for this device
NOBGO-ZRH1 - This device is ceased but still appears in the feed so we need to confirm it has been removed from the feed
PAPTY-ZRH1 - The device config is 26 days old on Skybox so we need an up to date config for this device

Hi Sri,

We have done our analysis over few devices till August 2018 (old events), accordingly we found that these devices are up and running (Discovered) but still we can see the Events are registered against these devices. So can you please check right now is there any event registered on these devices at Smarts.

And if the Event is registered then:
1)	We have to remove it
2)	We need to check, why they have not been removed according to the process

Hi Raj, 

We need to check their Last notify period.  There are some Async Interfaces reporting down on Smarts from Day 1 of their commissioning, because they are down by design and NOT by fault. Hence, we need to check Last Notify period of alarms and anything which has NOT got a count increased on LAST NOTIFY from last Six month, is something, which I would agree to be removed.

Subject: RE: Events to get removed from SMARTS

Hi Vivek,

If I am not wrong, Anubhav has shared all the events which were raised 6 months back in 2018. Ideally an alarm/event can?t be open for such a long time.
So Anubhav is checking as to why we have still open events from a very long time and if we can close these events/alarms 

Regards,
Rajashekar Reddy L

HOF-foftolcsw01 - not in SMARTS discovery report, or NMSL or Config Store. 
Jogi  - can you check if it?s in BFG and IN SERVICE with monitoring flags set?

hof-r-rush-02 -  Device pings and manually snmp polls with community string from snmptool. But needs polling flag and class setting in NMSL. However, has comment ?SA Brian Fairweather advised to stop the polling?.
Brian - do you know why polling was stopped on this one?


 
Thanks

Neil

Hi

Are you sure device is not named HOF-hoftolcsw01??

I did a cursory check on BFg and could find no reference to the device name you mentioned

But there was one called the device named above

I will do a more in depth check this morning as things were not all working last night when trying to run 360 for this customer

I am assuming it is customer CAP Gemini house of fraser??

Cheers

Nathan - can you confirm if its HOF-hoftolcsw01 and NOT HOF-foftolcsw01 that we should be looking at?

HOF-hoftolcsw01 - is managed and successfully discovered by SMARTS using ICMPSNMP so does not look to be any issue with that one. However, does look to have port alerts despite the ports being tagged BTNM for example:
false      NGSD    Port       PORT-hof-hoftolcsw01/10 [Gi1/10] [BTNM DMZADFS01-iLO]       Down    APM7-S-NET-roc                0              4074       Sun Feb 17 11:00:51 GMT 2019   Tue Jul 10 15:10:27 BST 2018        Sun Feb 17 11:05:48 GMT 2019

Which begs the question why are we seeing alerts for ports - my understanding was that ports are not managed by default unless they are tagged BTM. These are tagged BTNM so surely that?s 2 reasons why we shouldn?t be seeing the port alerts.

Suggest we discuss further on your return.

Thanks

Neil

Hi Vandana,

As informed earlier.This is due to heavy load in the Poller. The poller on which the DHL customer is configured is having sub-element count more than expected. Due to which we are observing this issue.

Thanks,

As discussed on IM, watch list is taking less time now to load the report as DEV team was already provided some alternative solutions to it. Nothing is pending from NIAB hence we are closing this case.

Updating the subject line with SR references of QOS

Hi Meenal,

We have received 3 SR?s related to QOS (CD814124, CD792867, CD800293) from you. 

PFB analysis.

For CD792867 : 

Device Name	Hostname	Interface	Device Status in NIAB	QOS Reports	
ETO-SK-3003	dhle-r-sk003-001-pl-p	GigabitEthernet0/0/0	InService	To be added newly

ETO-FR-3126	dhle-r-fr126-001-go-p	FastEthernet4	ceased	Meenal to check as device is already ceased	
ETO-FR-3126	dhle-r-fr126-002-go-s	FastEthernet4	ceased	Meenal to check as device is already ceased	
ETO-PT-3001	dhle-r-pt001-001-br-p	GigabitEthernet0/0	InService	To be added newly	
ETO-PT-3004	dhle-r-pt004-001-br-p	GigabitEthernet0/0	InService	To be added newly	
ETO-PT-3005	dhle-r-pt005-001-co-p	GigabitEthernet0/0	InService	To be added newly	

For CD800293 :

Device Name	Hostname	Interface	Device Status in NIAB	QOS Reports	
ETO-ES-3004	dhle-r-es004-001-go-p	GigabitEthernet0/0	In Service 	To be added newly 	
ETO-ES-3004	dhle-r-es004-002-go-s	GigabitEthernet0/0	In Service 	To be added newly	


For  CD814124 :

We could see that 804 unique devices were provided and out of which we can see 20  devices are not in NIAB or already ceased. 638 devices are to be newly added to QOS. Around 147 devices are already added for QOS we will further check on these 147 devices for the reason of not available in QOS reports. PFA I have attached excel sheet with comments.

So in total 6+2+638 = 646 devices to be added newly to QOS polling as part of all the 3 service requests.


As per FDR 769  ~4000 devices  was requested, As of now 1800+ devices are already on boarded. 

Also as per the server stats and current sizing we would have to upgrade our servers to accommodate any new devices for QOS Polling.

Hence could you please provide funding reference(JA Code) which would require for us to raise Capacity request for upgrade. 

Meanwhile request you to please verify the sheet provided by Jaya and let us know if any devices can be removed from existing QOS collector in order to accommodate few from this new list which is on priority.


P.S. We will close remaining 2 SR?s (CD792867, CD800293)  for QOS and keep only SR CD814124 open as all  3 are related to QOS device addition only. 



Thanks,

Hi Ranjeet,

We have checked that below mentioned IP address is not a part of device list shared by us. We have also checked that this device belongs to FNA-US_California network whereas all others devices shared earlier belong EU region.
Out of ~900 devices shared,  ~21 devices having credential issue at their end. Please fetch the latest dump for EU region only and confirm us for case closure.

Hi Fenny,

If it can help the below is a yesterday snapshot from our helpdesk team of all devices discovered under INASII.  Note we also have device with hostname emea-r-ham-01 in service since more than a month and this seem not to be discovered. Initially it was discovered but we had to replace the device by another type and I had to cease it on NMDB prior to be able to re-instate it on BFG and change the device type on BFG. Can you check if this is discovered now?  


Thanks and best regards

Hi NIAB/Mounisha,

Incidents were not created for the below device interfaces. I have checked the NIAB discovery report for these devices and found that they were ?Successfully Discovered?. 
As per data team, these interfaces were flapping therefore they can?t confirm the timings of interface down.

While checking on NIAB (Historic Events) I couldn?t find any tickets created for these devices.

Kindly further investigate the issue and share the RCA.

Could you please let us know by when we can receive the update. We need to close the case as there?s no action pending at IONIX end.
Once device team resolved credential issue at device end, then please re-trigger mli of the device from NMSL.

Hello BT Helpdesk,

Please be informed that we shutdown the BT connection at our location in Italy ? Cavezzo.
The contract for this is already ceased.

MPLS 1 = ch-panal-mod70-mil-eu
MPLS 2 = ch-panal-mod73-roa-eu
Webvpn = ??, but this link is already down

We will never bring them up, so you can remove them from monitoring.

And similar errors.
Looks like wer are not able to find $base_dir

Unsure when the issue has happened.
When the firewalls managers were included on IONIX they were R77.20 and now they are R77.30
is it posible somthing needs being changed on IONIX
We have similar issues on the other checkpoints but we want to fix this one 1st and then look at the others
We have alternate backups for these devices via other ways provided by checkpoint but we would like to fix this.

Smarts Team,

As we are processing level 1 syslog messages from Smarts onto GSAM, we can see a huge number of login failure messages (sent in email) which is an unwanted message and should not be processed.

Could you please check and advise if this can be stopped from getting processed as events? We have currently filtered it out from the production GSAM viewlets however these are flowing into SI which is not giving the correct picture of live events.

Hi All,

I have had a look at this & currently designed solution is not flexible enough to discard syslogs at lowest level. Infact it handles whatever hits it !
Any discarding can be down through console filters only. 

For me to re-design the solution will require considerable time and effort. 
Please highlight the urgency if this is still needed  ?

Hi Arjun/Bhanu, 

Can you please suggest on the expiration time for these Syslog messages. Surprised as I don?t see them on Rochdale and not sure if Rochdale is processing Such syslog. We current have a huge alarm difference on both Rochdale and Cardiff, and just trying to understand few reasons for same. For reference

Hi Fenny,

As discussed on call, can you please check whether on these devices any events are still active or not. We can see active events on these devices at SI front end and also the last notify date is very old, so can you please have a look into it.

Hi Meenal,

The devices have been added to the QoS collectors. As discussed on the call,  future addition of any new devices for QoS would require a hardware upgrade for the VM since the Collectors are at its peak capacity. We have added these devices in replacement to the devices that have been ceased. Please let me know in case of any queries/issues.

Hi Team,

As part of P2 CD530479 we have rebuilt the OS to OEL6-latest v3.0 on server - rdl11262app56 (194.102.0.214).
After rebuilting the OS, we faced lot of issues in our applications due OS mismatch on other servers which are running in lower OS version. So we need to plan for the OS upgrade on below servers as well.

rdl11262app55	194.102.0.213
rdl11262app105	194.102.0.248
rdl11262app40	194.102.0.207

rdl11262app42	194.102.0.209
rdl11262app103	194.102.0.219
rdl11262app104	194.102.0.220

NOTE: *** This is generic implementation note and required skills as  mentioned at the ""Skills Required:"" above

Radia is no longer is being used in Oracle Linux 6, and as a result Puppet is now being used in to deploy all optional, and standard toolsets.  

PRE-TASK BEFORE REBUILD

ASG -  responsible to confirm your application workability on  OL6

TSS -  Task will be required to TSLINUX to AIS server needed, this task will need to be at least the following day to the rebuild and AFTER any ASG software reinstall.  Speak to John Brown  and in his absense,  Ian  Wilkinson on step to add for AIS
 
TSS - remove server from spacewalk

ASG  ? list all mandatory packages (originally defined on SPIG. Such as CTRLM, HUNTER, BPTM, XFB, Oracle, Docker etc.)

ASG - to inform puppet  (e-mail software.delivery@bt.com  of upgrade to OEL6 and ask puppet team to configure/re-configure  mandatory packages from above and BT  toolset  (Vintela, BT Scan, Splunk etc.)

TSS -  Ensure that no application filesystems have been built under the rootvg as all data under rootvg will be lost and not imported later.  There may be a need to add  another disk to recreate any filesystems that were created under root before rebuild if possible.

IF ONLY you have access to server, run the command /usr/local/bin/BT-Sysreport.sh OTHERWISE search if any old config exist on http://yum3.dci.bt.com/gb/kickstart OR  via citrix http://unixcfg.nat.bt.com. If none, check any sister server from which to figure config out config with supportal data OR DDD / Build List

Abhinav,

As below:

Are we able to change the polling on the routers to 30 minutes
And the polling on Switches to 32 Minutes Minus all the datacentres.

William ? Can you confirm the hostname prefix for the data centres and for the devices in scope?

Thanks

Hi Parminder,

Script has been started to clear the Flood of alarms, please note the flood has happened because we have received huge number of syslogs probably because of the Power Related Planned Work that happened on 2nd March 21 GMT.

Each alarm will take a second to clear, currently total count of flooded alarms for ""NOTIFICATION-Generic-Script_<*PE*>_20#NoResource_SALMON_:POLLER"" is 63676.
We have to wait atleast 60-120 mins before the console can start showing alarms.

Full Description: I have access to the Ontario data for Bank of Ireland to complete their monthly reports. However, I need access to the WWD view of their report as well as the Bank Of Ireland FMS-24x7 View COntract that I currently have. On Shaun Kelly's login he has a navigation bar on the left side that allows him to swap views. We both believe this was working when we tested this when I first got access some time ago.

EMSE SMARTS Issue : Other Issues
No screenshot provided.
--------------------------------
Full Description: There are about 450 KPMG LLP devices that appear on the 
Managed Pending KPMG Primary report as ""No response from 
SNMP agent"". For the majority of these, there is a mismatch 
of the hostnames. 
For example, in the Smarts Discovery Report, the 
MAN_HOST_NAME for IP 10.217.234.12 is km_ukwat-swi-0227 but 
in BFG and nmsloader the MAN_HOST_NAME is km-ukwat-swi-0227.
The polling class is SMARTS-SNMP_PING_AND_POLL and status IS.
Is this discrepancy with ""km_ ""and ""km-"" in the hostnames 
causing an issue or does it match by IP address only?

The below case of NMDB-Probe-ID :- 227276 with
SourceIP :- 10.120.136.34 / 16447
Target IP :- 10.120.136.170 / 16384
Service Class :- 104
LifeTime :- 2147483647

After detailed Investigation we found that messages were flown as below
 
NMDB Message-ID :-128039096  2019/01/28 16:25 MessageType :- ProbeCreated
NMDB Message-ID :-128039535  2019/01/28 17:20 MessageType :- ProbeUpdated
NMDB Message-ID :-128693896  2019/02/08 12:10 MessageType :- ProbeUpdated
NMDB Message-ID :-128690485  2019/02/11 01:16 MessageType :- ProbeUpdated
 
and same set of messages were replayed around 2019/02/22 and hence it impacted the existing probe which was already configured on the device. From application point of view I don't see any replay done automatically, we need to identify whether it was done by NMDB or IONIX-ASG Team members. Will check for NMDB response and in parallel we can even have a word with ASG Team members about the replay as the replay is what created the issue

Hi Ikbal,

I have applied fix for it. For reference, PFA the extract of one of the interface from the list which you have provided which shows the timestamps for the missed polls too.

But, seems like there is some issue with the newer w4net version because the same works with the older version, we will be checking with the vendor for the same.

Basically we will need NIAB verification after each phase of the migration is complete.
scope of the request is to check if the devices are reachable from Soln SMARTS and NIAB after each phase of the link migration. Since NIAB is not yet live (i.e. users are still actively monitoring on Soln SMARTS), the checks would have to be done on both NIAB and Soln SMARTS.

Connectivity to one or other of these adresses will need to be reolved.
You will need to raise a request to the network team to resolve this.

rdl07163app17/194.102.0.157

Only has connectivity to one buildserver (147.152.245.14)
We now have an alternative build method to try and if that fails we have a 
workaround which was developed on the last burn and build, that 2should"" work in this instance.

AP EMSE to open and own the network investigation for rdl07163app14/62.239.12.32 

Plesae suggest .

bit confused with what supposedly works and what doesn't in this case...

Can you summarise or confirm that server  rdl07163app14 doesn't work or is working intermittently to the destination URL quoted and you are seeing the conflicting destination ip's? and that server rdl07163app17 is working as expected accessing the same destination without any issues?

Hi Abhay,

?	As discussed, this might be a certificate issue. I need to try with new certificate which will require a restart.

?	We can do this on one SMARTS (APM) service and verify for one router. 

?	If it works fine, then we can raise a CR and roll it out for entire RBS stack.

Hi Paul/Manas,

As per the my  investigation I found that  below devices are  sending the false temperature alert when I raised this concern with Smarts team then they found that this issue was certification issue so they want to change the new certification on devices because of that they want to restart the APM first in cardiff and second in Rochadle so outage will be there for some time so we need your approval  on this

Hi Abhay,

I have tried modifying the certificate for ?Cisco N7K-C7010? to see if it resolves this issue. However, it hasn?t worked.

Riswan,

Please raise a case with EMC and ask them to give us the RCA for this issue. 

Issue :   Cisco N7K-C7010  presenting false voltage sensor alarms due to incorrect MIB polled.

EMSE SMARTS Issue : Other Issues

Full Description: Checking contract EUV (Visa Europe), there are over 100 
devices where in nmsloader the snmp poller is unticked, the 
polling class is either SMARTS-SNMP_PING_AND_POLL or stop-stop 
however these devices are erroring with ""No response from SNMP 
agent"". Example devices are vi_rt_cro_int3_mar02, 
vi_rt_tur_eko3_mar01 & vi_sw_slk_tat1_mas02. Can you please 
explain why these devices are picked up for monitoring when 
the snmp poller is unticked? Is there something in Smarts
overriding this?

Hi Simon,

There is migration on going for VISA from Solution SMARTS to NIAB Smarts , hence devices are unchecked for SNMP Poller in NMDB .

You can reach out to ashutosh.awasthi@bt.com <mailto:ashutosh.awasthi@bt.com> for more details .

Hi David,
Sonali has already replied regarding this via mail and also she confirmed its in discussion with you as of now . Please find below for the reply sent by Sonali for your reference :
""Hi Peter/David,
 
As I have told earlier , I can check feasibility once I get MIB/OID for these parameters . If there is no MIB/OID available which can give us these values , W4N won?t be able to report on them.
As per my research /knowledge , didn?t find any MIB  on internet /vendor site which will give these info .
 
If someone from TDA can tell us ?is there any way to extract all these parameters directly from the device doing ssh/telnet to the device, then might be I can take that route for feasibility .
 
Thanks,
 
Regards,
Sonali|Standalone W4N-Design|Monitoring & Reporting""


Since this is a design query Sonali will help you in this via on-going mail .

Thus closing this SR.


Regards,
Sonal

Hi NIAB,

Capacity team has reported an issue where the LAN Interface Utilization report is showing incorrect interface utilization data in it. Please see the attached reports for reference.

Below snippet shows the speed of the interface is 20,000,000,000 bps, outbound throughput 1,993,290,202 bps and the interface utilization is above 65%. This seems NIAB is calculating incorrect data for interface utilization. All these interfaces have speed of 20G and showing throughput as around 2G while in percentage it is showing as 70% which should reflect as 10%.

There are many interfaces which are getting populated incorrectly.

Could you please check why NIAB is populating incorrect data? Case CD929585 has been dispatched to your queue.

As discussed yesterday, speed were blank for the interfaces because it has been removed before report generation.

Interface speed is not polled value, it is appearing when discovery happens for the device/interfaces.

Since interfaces were get removed/untagged, hence after weekend full discovery these interfaces were not available.
Hence speed was missing, but aggregated value will be available as interfaces were available in the month.

NOTE

Radia is no longer is being used in Oracle Linux 6, and as a result Puppet is now being used in to deploy all optional, and standard toolsets.  

Prior to turning on the VMs, e-mail the Puppet team (software.delivery@bt.com) with a list of Oracle Linux 6 hostnames that will be built. This will allow SSL certificates to be pre-signed  for these VMs, and configuration to be set up for initially only mandatory packages (Vintela, BT Scan, Splunk etc.).   
This is done automatically if run through Autobuild. 

PRE-TASK BEFORE REBUILD

ASG -  confirm that review of your application working effectively on OL6 is completed and approved

TSS -  Task will be required to TSLINUX to AIS server needed, this task will need to be at least the following day to the rebuild and AFTER any ASG software reinstall. Speak to 
            John Brown  and in his absense,  Ian  Wilkinson on step to add for AIS
 
TSS - remove server from spacewalk

ASG  ? list all mandatory packages (originally defined on SPIG. Such as CTRLM, HUNTER, BPTM, XFB, Oracle, Docker etc.)

ASG - to inform puppet  (e-mail software.delivery@bt.com  of upgrade to OEL6U4 and ask puppet team to configure/re-configure  mandatory packages from above and BT toolset   (Vintela, BT Scan, Splunk etc.)

TSS -  Ensure that no application filesystems have been built under the rootvg as all data under rootvg will be lost and not imported later.  There may be a need to add another disk to  recreate any filesystems that were created under root before rebuild if possible.

Hi All,
 
Apologies for the delay in response, as it took long time for investigation. 

As per the observation, the Qos Bandwidth(susrate) is not configured for the classmap 'class-default' that's why the entries are not coming in the report. For whichever classes the QoS Bandwidth are configured, we are getting the entries for those classmap. However, on performing the snmpwalk for the devices, we are getting the bandwidth  for those classmap which are configured. PFB the snmpwalk results and W4Net result for the same. PFB the analysis for one of the devices where we can see that the bandwidth obtained from snmpwalk is matching the bandwidth values in watch4net report. Also, we can see in the index of the report that the field is there for class-default as well but as the susrate is not configured the entries are not coming in the report. Please check with the device config team to get this issue fixed.
 
Please let us know if you have any other concern/query regarding the same.

Thank you Nikhil for your assistance. I have raised the MUI request and it is pending approval with my LM and TA.

You can close the SR for the time being. If I face any issues, I will raise another one.

Hi Nikhil,

I cannot find the customers I am looking for in the MUI section. The customers I am looking for are SAINT_GOBAIN_LIMITED (BFG_CUS_ID = 2522050) and SAINT_GOBAIN - 1 (BFG_CUS_ID = 30753).

Hence, requesting you to assist me on this and not close the request.

Hi Sudipta

To get extract from IONIX, you need to apply for access via MUI. Once you get the access you can fetch the report as per your requirement.

MUI Link : http://identityservices-mui.intra.bt.com/LandingPage/Home.htm 

Please let us know if we can proceed for case archival.



Thanks
Nikhil

We have introduced a new type of device to the PSBA Customer/Contract, which is a Cisco Nexus Switch. There are two switches of this type - hostnames are ?psbm-sw-ngd-fil-01? and ?psbm-sw-ngd-fil-02?.

However we can?t see these devices in Ionix NCM and can?t view and upload new config. Apparently there may be some plugin or configuration that you need to do to Ionix NCM so we can then see and edit these switches in NCM.

Hi Atul,

As discussed with NIAB team interface port-channel230.100 is still BTCM tagged because of which the device interface is discovered in NIAB side and the alert was generated for the same. So please change the tagging of that interface to BTNM to stop generating alert for that interface.

Regards
Viney Kumar

Hi Sachin/NIAB Team,

As discussed- There is need to enrich the event text and severity for the existing traps types that we have configured in NIAB. See below.

1.	Remove the unwanted characters from event text for already configured ARX traps (npUserTrafficTrap).

Refer below table for varbinds that appear in the policy related alarms in the Event text currently that needs to be shipshape as requested in below table.

2.	 The alerts having Name as highlighted in green- Should be set as CRITICAL in NIAB


Pls review and let me know if you need any additional info to complete this task.

Thx.

Hi Team,

Could you please check are we getting any traps from 10.142.114.131 to NIAB(147.152.69.61 ,147.152.69.65, 147.152.69.69, 147.152.69.21)servers on 162 port.

Hi Team,

Traffic flows into EMSE as follows:
 
ZIG Network CPE SNMP Trap -> MTN Circuit > MPE > MCE > EMSE Customer Facing Firewall VS059 (Destination NAT for ZIG DMZ) > PBR > DMZ Firewall (VS047) > SMARTS Server?
 
trap can be seen reaching VS059, it then NAT?s the destination correctly, and you can see the traffic on the DMZ firewall ? next hop is the server. 

Source :10.142.114.131
Destination :147.152.69.61 ,147.152.69.65, 147.152.69.69, 147.152.69.21
port :162

device is sending a trap towards destinations (147.152.69.61 ,147.152.69.65, 147.152.69.69, 147.152.69.21) however we couldn't see that on these servers
in tcpdump
please let us know steps which can be used to check it further

Hi Manjusha/Jitendra,

As discussed in Yesterday's call with design,

PFB latest on this:

Hi Jitendra,
 
As discussed, we will discard these alerts. (I still believe this discarding could have been enabled at verint end)
 
This will require code level changes but we will do this because we also want our customers to have better monitoring experience.

The root password is expired for Legacy Secondary Servers. We have raised a case with MPA team for resolution.

Once server is accessible, I will configure same in secondary and update you.

Full Description: I am trying to access the section of the BANK OF IRELAND report called FMS-WWD on Ontario but I am unable access it as I do not have a navigation bar to access it. My colleague Shaun Kelly (UIN 802366670) has correct access and I need to be set up the same as he is.
I have tried solve this before but MUI request does not work as it correctly recognises that I already  have access to the BOI report and does not let me submit another request, even though I now require something new added onto my access.

Please help check urgently if the account is locked; and if yes; please help reset the same. We have important IOS upgrades planned and we need to use this NCM server to download IOS images to the devices.

2. Enable Normal User to add IOS images to the NIAB NCM GUI  in the OS Inventory section.. This is required asap as the team is not able to use NIAB IONIX to push images to the devices. For large files; IONIX is the only reliable way to push IOS images

3.Enable the Manual Single device Auto discovery in IONIX (both 50k and NIAB IONIX). We need this enabled to be able to pull some device configs that we need to transition for Pepsico South Africa? but don?t have access to perform manual discovery currently. We have SNMP credentials for the devices and the devices are configured to allow polling from the IONIX 50k servers; so Pulling the devices into IONIX is the only way to get their configs.

Issue here is not with NMSL please , she is trying to say the device was not down till the wait time (alarm got cleared before 8mins ), hence no auto ticket created .

Hi Paul,

 

 

PFB the logs that I found for the device you requested. The wait time is 480 secs(8 minutes), that is greater than the log timings(as highlighted below). This is the reason why auto-ticketing is not being raised.

Please let me know if you have further queries.

Requesting closure of the case.

Hi Team ,
We are planning to upgrade all our Watch4net servers as their version of OS is already EOSL . We have queries which are in need of your inputs before raising CR for the upgrade :
1.How many servers can be added in CR for the upgrade ?
2. How many hours/days are required for one CR/ server?
3.What is the latest version server could be upgraded to?
4. Certain servers are yet to be RFS certified/not yet backuped , so will the upgrade effect them?

These are the few servers we are planning in phase 1 :

For more details refer : RE: CE074052 - Italy Graphs Values Missed

Hi Naveen,

The Monthly and Weekly reports for Device and Interface are available on the portal. The earlier count before the removal of filter was approximately 9K interfaces and the current count is 12,155 interfaces. The difference of 3K interfaces do not have values for the IfInError metric which is present for the other 9k interfaces.

Please note the filter for IfInErrors is present by default on all Interface reports for SLA-DB. Please let me know in case of any other queries/issues.

Thanks & regards,
Jayalaxmi Poojary.

Hi Bhanu,

I want to extend the wait time for PBSA (Welsh Governement)..... HOWEVER, the customer is very very ( X100) cautious !!!!
They want me to extend the wait time on just one device only psbe-bgc-ua02-087
If this increase in wait time is successful i.e. no false tickets, then we can apply the wait time to ?more? PSBA devices.
I know we usually apply the wait time to a whole customer, but I would really appreciate your support on this approach.

Cheers

Hi Anshul,

We have checked logs and cannot see any alarms with event *Eigrp* 

As per the data I have we can see the traps has been configured for below. Also, after the deployed there was no testing made by the requester.

Hence going ahead we need to test after sending the traps for below mentioned event.

# cEigrpNbrDownEvent 
#cEigrpAuthFailureEvent
# cEigrpRouteStuckInActive

Based on your confirmation we will schedule a call for the same.

Please let us know if you have any query/concerns.

Hi Shailesh,
Unfortunately BT Enterprise will not be in a position to authorise this CR until we have confidence that what is shown in Cardiff is the ?full picture? i.e. All BT Enterprise SMARTS managed devices are discovered and manged in BOTH Rochdale and Cardiff.
Just looking at today?s Rochdale vs Cardiff SMARTS view for our MSfBT bucket (1000+ customers) and we have almost a 50% difference, and a similar % gap in our Manged T1-3 bucket
We cannot accept the RISK of missing Incidents due to gaps in the monitoring if we have to run on the Cardiff instance.

Hi Anotnio,

This error "" SWFE-E-EGETNEXT-While getting next of OID"" does mean that the device is not discovered or it cannot be monitored.
This only means that while doing discover current node it is unable to find next OID(next node).

It will not cause any harm while monitoring the devices.

Thanks and Regards,

Hi Istvan,

The speed configuration can't be changed/corrected at our end. 

FYI- At Watch4net end, the interface speed is polled/received by metric - ifSpeed using  oid ?.1.3.6.1.2.1.2.2.1.5?? coming from the device end . This speed is later reported as interface speed at the Watch4net Frontend. We can't therefore modify the configuration as it is directly coming from the device.

Thus this needs to checked/corrected by the device end/ team. ?

No action point on W4N, thus closing the case.

As we can see there is no problem with BMS ticketing.
If you want to check for specific alarms kindly let us know the events for which you want to check.

Rest ticketing is fine in BMS.

Hi Christopher ,

We do not see these devices in SMARTS and if you want to stop monitoring of these devices please get them ceased/decommissioned from NMDB which should be done by contract TDA.

The device polling for Watch4net is done by SMARTS.Once it is discovered successfully in SMARTS, the device will reflect in Watch4net.

Thus looping Riswan/SMARTS team to check if the device is in discovered in Smarts.

Could you please let us know if the below device is discovered in SMARTS.

Hi Paul,

 

PFA Auto Ticket Rules/Wait Time for the Cooperative Customer.

 

On the second query for logs from 1st march ( for mentioned devices) :

BT log retention policy is for 30 days, so I am afraid we don?t have the logs for you.

 

Let me know if you have any other queries.

Requesting closure of  the case.

This is a pc issue and not with the Citrix system. I would suggest forwarding the case to the local desktop support team  and asking them to :
Uninstall the Citrix client
Restart the PC

EMSE SMARTS Issue : Other Issues
No screenshot provided.
--------------------------------
Full Description: On 10/04/19 the Thurso NOC received 100s of False Tickets due to the SMARTS Network Connectivity problem.
We did not expect a flood of tickets, as we expect SMARTS FPM to prevent this.


Please advise what FPM is in place for 
Thurso Managed Customers
Specifically we need to know WHAT conditions should trigger the FPM.

Key customers are COOP, Santander and DCG.

Hi both,

Hope you are well, can you answer me a question about FPM, I thought we had it set for Santander, COOP, Dixons. Last night we had a SMARTS flood, 200 Santander auto tickets and 200 COOP Auto tickets. From our conversations FPM is designed to stop this. We now have 400 Issues to admin through NGSD.

Any ideas?

So due to a mistake these were ceased, but at the present they were re-commissioned on put in life status again, in fact, now the other BT tools have put them in their host lists, however on the SMARTS hostlookuptool, they are not available yet (since 7 days ago), in spite of we can connect by the connections options on SMARTS, and in fact, if we put the hostname of the devices on the SNMP tool they respond by the BAT SNMP communities.

Therefore I request your assistance to validate this because Im not sure if the proactive monitoring is on risk for them.  The details of they are;

Hostname	bxt-am-camo01-rtr-1
SiteID	AM-CA-CAMO01
Mgmt IP	10.250.8.18
	
Hostname	bxt-am-camo01-rtr-7
SiteID	AM-CA-CAMO01
Mgmt IP	10.250.17.6


Thank you in advance

Regards,

Hi Saurabh,

As per the design sizing is only for 4000 devices for Nationwide contract. 

Current count of devices is 3660 , since you have mentioned 461 devices to be added for ICMP only so we can accommodate it.

So in total 3660+461 = 4121 devices and hence 121 additional devices beyond the current sizing.


Please Note : We will not be able to accommodate any new devices for NBS contract after the addition of these 461 devices (ICMP ONLY).

Subject: RE: EUROPEAN METAL RECYCLING LIMITED - Please amend the wait timers, severities and rules - CE208455 

Hello,

All looks well apart from EMR* prefix is still not auto-ticketing.

Could this be due to the Hostname being incorrect on BFG vs NMDB?

Hi Nitesh,

Interfaces will be monitored in SMARTS by default and doesn?t require any tagging explicitly to manage them .

Now I can see this interface is being monitored in SMARTS and alarming genuinely down as their Adminstatus is UP and Operstatus is DOWN .

If you don?t need this to alarm , kindly tag BTNM to their interface description .

Passing to the ASG as you should now be able to login and to housekeep the file above and prevent it from generating under /var.

Hello Ashutosh ,

When smarts generated the alarm it generated on parent interface of that sub-interface, and the parent interface was not tagged, hence the alarm didnt come up on the console.

This case is already open with Visa member & TDA , the tagging is to be done. They are still discussing on it.

As ASG support team , this will not be under our scope . Please have check & let us know if everything is fine to close case.

Regards,
Pawan Malani

Hi Istvan,

If i remove the three conditions from the rule, then there are no other conditions for which the tickets are created for W4N. So removing the W4N rule itself. 
In future if you need any thing to be ticketed  for W4N please raise the SR.

Dear Team,

Is there any possibility to modify the rule somehow that when a ticket against an access switch is raised it should be a sev 3 ticket, even if it is a site level ticket? 

Vinutha Kempaiah advised to raise a request to check the feasibility. Maybe we can try if any filters can be applied for only Access Switches.

Devices are not responding to snmp ping and not discovery in SMARTS that's why no tickets were created.

Sorry for earlier mail.

I got these alarms in frontend but they are not getting ticketed because no ticketing rules are configured for LoadBalancer (Class) in Anglo American.

Dear Team,

Please investigate why we are not getting auto tickets for devices given below.

After changing to SMARTS-SNMP_POLL_AND_PING. we can now see an alarm in SMARTS however ? No auto Ticket Raised?.

Please share reason for the same.

There is nothing strange here to know the reason for request. We are working on the SR within SLA, so required details will make us to progress.

There is no ticketing available for these contracts in NIAB.

Hi Surya,
Wait timer details are required to re-evaluate wait timer, as some of the new incidents were observed were wait timer seems pretty less.
I am not getting any report from Niab, can you or Ponty/Satish share the latest with me.
Strange to know that it took 3 days, just to ask reason why report ia required??
Can you share the require information on priority

Hi Meenal,

As mentioned in the previous mails, interfaces GigabitEthernet0/1 and GigabitEthernet0/1.5027 are returning bandwidth as expected and for GigabitEthernet0/0 its value is still 100 mbps and as per the below mail sent from Deepak, it is not required to configure bandwidth on it since it?s a LAN interface. PFB the snapshot from Watch4net for all the three interfaces.

Please let me know in case of any queries.

As discussed on IM, could you please share the Auto Ticketing Rules for BMS and PEPSICO INTERNATIONAL which mentions what severity is assigned against devices.

For e.g. :
?	what severity is assigned for Routers, if it goes down ? Is it P1/P2/P3/P4/P5 ?
?	what severity is assigned for Interfaces, if it goes down ? Is it P1/P2/P3/P4/P5 ? 
?	e.t.c

Also, if you have a process documet, then do share that.

Hello Antonio, 

All right, noted. I can only advise what I see from NOC perspective: these monitoring system (no auto-ticket) related outages tend to happen quite often lately. I am okay with that if this last one was an isolated issue and hopefully all the defects has been addressed to the responsible team and all has been sorted.

Subject: RE: ** CE263788** RE: BMS Disassociated AP's

Balazs,

This particular incident is an isolated one. 
The nGTA observer which processes requests, was inoperative and therefore any incidents causing events were missed during that period.
The ASG has been made aware of the customer visibility this outage involved.

The team has advised that measures have been taken to reduce the possibility of reoccurrence.

However if you any similar situations where an auto ticket wasn?t created  for any devices (after April 27th..) all though it met all ticket rule criteria ?Please let me know and we will follow up with ASG?s.

Thank you.

Sincerely,


Antonio Trinidad

Subject: Monitoring issue - Project Xian BTSS

Hi Brian,

Hope you?re well.

Just reaching out to you to see if you could point me in the right direction. I?m the service manager for Project Xian which is managed through Thurso assurance on a reactive basis. We provide ADSL lines for the customer and recently the guys on the desk have been receiving proactive alerts when these circuits go down which historically they never received.

I checked with the delivery manager who advised she wasn?t aw
are of any change being made in the way these circuits are being delivered so I?m trying to work out at what point monitoring is being added to these circuits. I usually deal with customers managed out of Belfast iNOC so I?m aware of the process used here but I?m not sure of the process used for Thurso. Is this something you could advise on?

I was also provided the following examples, 

INC000002116303 - bxcs-r-btbbmr262177
INC000002117632 - bxcs-r-btbbmr262230

It seems the VSS bundled devices are not generating alarms if the CPU utilisation is high only on 1 member.

There is an on-going issue with zeu-ch-scun-vws01, where the active member has 100 % CPU load since 24.04.2019 and no CPU utilisation alarm was received ? attached you can find the alarms since 23.04.2019:
[cid:image001.png@01D50656.81A0A280]
[cid:image003.png@01D50656.81A0A280]
When I issue the ?show processes cpu history? command to check the CPU load separately, I can see the switch has high CPU load:

zeu-ch-scun-vws01#sh proc cpu hist

Hi Savita,

PFB the investigation carried out For each Event.
1)	Power Supply

Smarts polls the ciscoEnvMonSupplyState OID ( 1.3.6.1.4.1.9.9.13.1.5.1.3 ) from the CISCO-ENVMON-MIB to poll power supply state .

The following shows the status possibilities of this OID:

OID .1.3.6.1.4.1.9.9.13.1.5.1.3

Type CiscoEnvMonState

1:normal
2:warning
3:critical
4:shutdown
5:notPresent
6:notFunctioning

A StateNotNormal event is generated when the ciscoEnvMonSupplyState OID reports a status of Warning, Critical, Shutdown or notFunctioning .

PFB the SNMP Walk Result for it.

[root@rdl07163app148 out]# sm_snmp --useif=194.102.0.183 -c 4ppl3s4uc3 -d pep-ukra-031-cs02 walk .1.3.6.1.4.1.9.9.13.1.5.1.3

SNMP Walk MIB starting at .1.3.6.1.4.1.9.9.13.1.5.1.3
.1.3.6.1.4.1.9.9.13.1.5.1.3.1014 = 4-a 4 = Shutdown = StateNotNormal
.1.3.6.1.4.1.9.9.13.1.5.1.3.1015 = 1


Hence the Alarm is genuine.

.1.3.6.1.4.1.9.9.117.1.2.1.1.2. 17 = 7aCRITICAL 

Smarts is polling cefcModuleOperStatus to check the card fault status .
 
CISCO-ENTITY-FRU-CONTROL-MIB::cefcModuleOperStatus = 1.3.6.1.4.1.9.9.117.1.2.1.1.2
(1) unknown - Critical
(2) OK - Clear
(3) disabled - Clear
(4) OK (diag failed) - Warning
(5) boot - Warning
(6) self-test - Warning
(7) failed - Critical

Hence These Alarms are Genuine.



3)	Fan

Hi Riswan,

Thank you for the update.

The below devices are Meraki access points so I?m not sure if the SNMP should work here as I could not see any SNMP settings.

Can you please advised if SNMP monitoring is working on other Nexans Meraki APs? If not we can just enable ping monitoring for these devices.

Hi Pranay,

I can see in the report which I just trigged some time back , DLSS was running at that time as Praveen had ran manual DLSS so those 30 devices are still picked during that time

You can check and fix those ping /snmp issues .
